# WebSocket 

WebSocket is a windows command line application that serves as an all in one socket connection tool. While the focus is largely on standard ports/protocols such as ftp, telnet, and http; the source code can easily be adapted to support any client/server application on any port. 

### Current Features 
* Functional ftp client.  

### Future Features 

Future features will include but not be limited to: 

* support for all major protocols.
* a windows gui
* the ability to connect to any protocol using non standard ports. IE. http running on 8080 instead of 80. 

## Installation 

Download either websocket.zip or websocket.7z to the desired directory. 7-zip is required to install websocket.7z. 

websocket.zip 

```bash
unzip websocket.zip
```

websocket.7z 

```bash
7za x websocket.7z
```

## Usage 

```bash
websocket address port
```

## Contribute

This is largely a self learning project so outside contributors will not be accepted before reaching version 2.0.0. However you're always free to fork the project at anytime. I will likely monitor any forks so features and bug fixes may make its way back to the original project.

#WebSocket 

WebSocket is a windows command line application that serves as an all in one socket connection tool. While the focus is largely on standard ports/protocols such as ftp, telnet, and http; the source code can easily be adapted to support any client/server application on any port. 

###Current Features 
-Functional ftp client capable of connecting to and communicating with servers using UTF-8 or ASNI. Actual file transfer however has not been tested. 

###Future Features 

Future features will include but not be limited to: 

-support for all major protocols.
-a windows gui
-the ability to connect to any protocol using non standard ports. IE. http running on 8080 instead of 80.
